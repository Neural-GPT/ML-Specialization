# ML-Specialization
I'll be uploading certificates and codes I produce from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization from Coursera. Edit: I won't be uploading notes from now since my handwriting is not
good and projects matter more to build a profile. Also main projects from here like my_models.py will also be uploaded on ML-Projects repo.
