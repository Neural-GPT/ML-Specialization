my_models.py: my mini library encompassing Linear and Logistic Regression models coded by me from scratch in numpy! It has automatic weight assignment using np.zeros, inbuilt support 
for DataFrames, methods for getting model coefficients & bias, lambda regularization, inbuilt plotting support for epochs vs cost with option for log cost as well for better intuition. 
The code is easy to understand and you can modify to your desire easily. Fun Fact: I used it to get 76.076% score on leaderboard of Kaggle Titanic!
